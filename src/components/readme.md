📁 components

The "components" folder is a crucial part of your React Native application, serving as a container for reusable and modular UI elements. These components can be shared across different screens, providing a consistent and maintainable structure to your application.

📂 components/Button
This subfolder might include React Native components that represent buttons. These can be styled and configured to suit the design language of your application. Reusing the same button component throughout the app ensures a cohesive look and behavior.

📂 components/Header
In this subfolder, you may store components related to headers. Headers often include titles, navigation elements, or icons. By centralizing header components, you can easily manage and modify the app's navigation and layout.

📂 components/Card
If your application displays cards with specific content and styling, this subfolder can host components related to cards. Cards commonly contain images, text, and buttons and can be reused across various screens.

📂 components/Modal
Modal components, used for displaying pop-up overlays or modals, can be organized in this subfolder. Modals are often reusable for different types of content and interactions.

📂 components/List
A subfolder for list-related components, such as ListItem or ListContainer. These components help structure and style lists of items, making it easier to maintain a consistent design for various lists in your app.

📂 components/...

You can create additional subfolders based on the specific needs of your application. For instance, "Form" for form-related components or "Avatar" for components related to user avatars.

## Components

The "components" folder contains reusable UI elements that contribute to the overall structure and appearance of the app. Here's a breakdown of key subfolders:

### Button

The `Button` component provides a consistent button style throughout the application. Import and use it as follows:

// components/Card.js

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';


const Card = ({ title, content }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.card}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>{title}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.content}>{content}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};


const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  card: {
    backgroundColor: 'white',
    padding: 16,
    borderRadius: 8,
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.3,
    shadowRadius: 4,
    elevation: 5,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 8,
  },
  content: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: '#555',
  },
});

export default Card;


In this example, we've created a component named Card. This component represents a card and takes a title and content through props. A style array is used for styling, but it can be customized to fit the design language of your application.

Next, an example usage demonstrating how to use this Card component in a screen component:


// MyScreen.js

import React from 'react';
import { Card } from '../components/Card';

const MyScreen = () => {
  return (
    <Card title="Card Title" content="Card content goes here" />
  );
};

export default MyScreen;


This way, the MyScreen screen includes a card component that can be reused anywhere in your application.









export default MyFormScreen;
