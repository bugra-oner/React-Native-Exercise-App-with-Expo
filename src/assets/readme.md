📁 assets

This folder contains visual and animation files used in your application. For functionality and organization purposes, it is recommended to categorize items within this folder.

📂 assets/images
This subfolder typically holds visual content for your application, such as the application logo, background images, or other visual elements.

📂 assets/gifs
This subfolder contains animation files, specifically GIFs. You can use GIF animations to enhance the liveliness of your application or make user interactions more engaging.

📂 assets/icons
In this subfolder, you can store icon files used throughout your application. Icons are often used for navigation, buttons, or any other visual representation of actions.

📂 assets/fonts
Fonts necessary for your application's styling and consistency can be stored here. Import these fonts into your stylesheets to maintain a consistent typographic theme.

To use these files in your project, you need to import them into the relevant files of your project. For example, to use an image:


// In a React component
// import React from 'react';
// import { Image } from 'react-native';

// const MyComponent = () => {
//   return (
//     <Image
//       source={require('../assets/images/myImage.png')}
//       style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
//     />
//   );
// };

// export default MyComponent;
