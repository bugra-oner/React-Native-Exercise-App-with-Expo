# Hooks Folder

The `hooks` folder is dedicated to housing custom React hooks in your React Native application. Hooks are reusable functions that enable functional components to access state and lifecycle features. This folder typically contains individual files, each representing a specific custom hook.

## Purpose of Hooks:

Hooks in React Native serve as a way to reuse stateful logic between components. They allow functional components to have state, lifecycle methods, and other React features without the need for class components. The `hooks` folder is where you organize and store these custom hooks.

## Files in the Hooks Folder:

### `useCustomHook.js`

This file represents an example custom hook. Custom hooks usually start with the "use" prefix and encapsulate a specific piece of logic that can be reused across multiple components.

#### Example Custom Hook:

```jsx
// useCustomHook.js

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

/**
 * A custom hook example that manages a simple counter.
 * @returns {Object} An object with the current count and a function to increment it.
 */
const useCustomHook = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Perform side effects or subscriptions related to the count (e.g., logging)
    console.log(`Count has been updated: ${count}`);

    // Cleanup function (optional)
    return () => {
      console.log('Component unmounted or count changed');
    };
  }, [count]);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  // Return the state and any functions that need to be accessible to components using this hook
  return {
    count,
    incrementCount,
  };
};

export default useCustomHook;

This example hook manages a simple counter with logging and cleanup functionality.

Additional Hooks:
You can create additional hooks in separate files based on your application's needs. For example, useApiData.js for handling API calls or useTheme.js for managing theme-related logic.

Feel free to organize hooks based on their functionality to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.


This example readme provides a general overview of the `hooks` folder's purpose, the expected content of hook files, and a specific example (`useCustomHook.js`). If you have specific hooks you'd like detailed explanations for, feel free to share them, and I'll provide step-by-step explanations.
