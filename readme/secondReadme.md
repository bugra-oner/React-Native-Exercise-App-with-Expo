First of all, before starting this project, 
learn how to start a project with react-native expo yourself. 
Go to the website and create an application with react-native expo independent of this project.



!!!! Not: The aim here is to run react-native and react-native expo on your computer without any problems. This way, you will not encounter any problems when starting this project.

!!! Not Real Device: If you install react-native cli and successfully start a new project from scratch and see that screen, you can use react-native expo on both the real device and the virtual device.

!!! My suggestion is that if you are learning react-native, which is a very laborious process, install both the CLI and EXPO, create a project from scratch, and after seeing a blank screen, come here and work on this project.



https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup react-native cli 
https://docs.expo.dev/ expo


If you are a new mobile developer, you should install these two and start a project to avoid any errors.

If you have successfully created 2 empty projects, you are ready to come and start working on this project and resources.

If you can successfully create a project with both options and do not encounter any problems, go to the installation.md file and run this project.
