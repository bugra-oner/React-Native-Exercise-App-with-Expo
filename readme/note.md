The reading order should be as follows
first readme
second readme

starting

Note: The most important part of coding is problem-solving, researching, and practicing. 
If you encounter an error, search the internet during the installation.
 I'll provide you with links assuming you have no prior knowledge, and you can learn components by reading the documentation for React Native and React Native Expo on these provided links.


https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

This is a react-native cli, where it is used for a react-native cli instead of expo, we usually use it to use a virtual device.
 It tells about the general installation on the link I sent, of course, you can watch it in the video for installation

 https://reactnative.dev/ // React-native website
 https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis // Components


We use expo
 https://docs.expo.dev/
