## app.js

`app.js` is the starting point of a React Native application. Configuration, rendering of the main component, and other basic settings can be found here.

## Navigation

Navigation allows the application to transition between its pages. It can be created using libraries like React Navigation.

## node_modules

The `node_modules` folder contains the project's dependencies. Manually modifying this folder is generally not recommended; it is automatically generated using package managers like npm or yarn.

## babel.config

`babel.config` contains the Babel settings used in the project. Babel is used to transpile ECMAScript 6+ code into earlier versions and ensure compatibility across different browsers.

## eas.json

`eas.json` holds the Expo Application Services (EAS) settings. EAS is a service used to develop and distribute Expo projects.

## components

The `components` folder includes reusable components used in the application. These components typically represent reusable UI elements.

## assets

The `assets` folder contains static files used by the application, such as images, audio files, etc.

## animations

The `animations` folder includes files for animations used within the application. Animations are often created using the React Native Animated API or other animation libraries.

## screens

The `screens` folder includes different screens of the application. Each screen typically contains a component and represents a specific section of the application.

## services

The `services` folder includes different services used by the application, such as API calls, database interactions, etc.

## i18n

The `i18n` folder includes files for internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages in the application.

## hooks

The `hooks` folder includes custom React hooks. These hooks facilitate sharing logic and state between components.

## helpers

The `helpers` folder includes utility functions used within the application. These functions often have reusable helper functionalities.

## data

The `data` folder includes files related to user data, configuration files, or other data sources for the application.

## app.json

`app.json` contains the overall configuration of the Expo project. The application's name, version, icons, and other Expo-specific features are defined in this file.
